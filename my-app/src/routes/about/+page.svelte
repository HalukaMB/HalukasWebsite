	<h1>About me</h1>

	<div>
		My name is Haluka Maier-Borst. 
		I am a bit of a dev. I am a little bit more of a data scientist. 
		And I am definitely a curious, know-it-all, but still capable of self-doubt journalist. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Currently, I am the team lead of the 
		<span>data, interactive and visual team</span>
		at a German business newspaper Handelsblatt.
		Or short, we are the <span>&lt;div&gt;</span>-team.
